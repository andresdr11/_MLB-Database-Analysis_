Welcome to the MLB Database Analysis project by Vicente and Andres. We're utilizing PostgreSQL and SQL to examine the Lahman's Baseball dataset, which contains extensive baseball statistics from 1871 to 2015. Our primary objective is to demonstrate our analytical skills using SQL and, in the subsequent phases, replicate the analysis in Python.


## **Objective**
Our project aims to deliver a comprehensive analysis of the MLB database, showcasing our expertise in SQL and data analysis. The key objectives are:

1. Exploratory Analysis: We have completed a thorough exploration of the MLB database using SQL.
2. Python Replication: Our next step is to replicate our SQL-based analysis using Python's Pandas and Polars libraries.
3. Efficiency Assessment: We will evaluate the efficiency of Python Polars as compared to Pandas.
4. Data Visualization: Our analysis will include the creation of informative data visualizations, including Tableau dashboards and potentially leveraging Matplotlib and Seaborn.
5. Machine Learning: In the final phase, we will apply machine learning techniques to predict trends in baseball statistics and assess model accuracy using data beyond 2015.

## **Dataset Overview**
We are working with tables such as player, team, batting, and salary, which provide comprehensive insights into players, teams, and financial aspects within MLB.

## **Highlights**
Key areas of our analysis encompass:

1. Player Performance: Identifying top-performing players in terms of home runs and other relevant metrics.
2. Team Insights: Analyzing team-related aspects, including salary structures, attendance, and player compensation.
3. Historical Trends: Investigating historical trends in baseball statistics, such as strikeouts, home runs, and team victories.
4. Comparative Analysis: Conducting comparative analyses, including cost-effectiveness of teams and salary disparities.

## **Roadmap**
Our project roadmap is as follows:

- SQL: We have completed the SQL analysis.
- Python Pandas: We have completed the replicate of the SQL analysis using Python's Pandas library.
- Python Polars: After the Pandas phase, we will use Python Polars to replicate and assess the difference in efficiency between Pandas and Polars.
- Data Visualization: We will create data visualizations, including Tableau dashboards, as well as explore Matplotlib and Seaborn for Python-based graphs.
- Machine Learning: In this final phase, we will apply machine learning techniques to predict trends in baseball statistics and assess model accuracy using data beyond 2015.

## **Future Updates**
We are committed to keeping this project updated as we progress through our roadmap
(and maybe include an interactive web page using HTML and CSS).

**Getting Started**
To begin your exploration of baseball data with us, ensure you have access to a PostgreSQL database with the Lahman's Baseball dataset. You can obtain it (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seanlahman/the-history-of-baseball/download?datasetVersionNumber=2).

Thank you for joining us on this analytical journey.
